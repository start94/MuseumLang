# MuseumLang
Machine Learning project for automatic language identification in museum descriptions.
# MuseumLangID Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to automatically detect the language of museum descriptions.

## Technologies used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Machine Learning (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest)
- TF-IDF vectorization with character n-grams

## Project Overview
The model can classify descriptions written in multiple languages by extracting meaningful features and training multiple classifiers.
